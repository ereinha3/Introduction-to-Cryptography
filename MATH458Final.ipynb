    "i) For the most part, encryption with a relatively small exponent is relatively safe. One potential break in the algorithm could be a non-modular e^th root attack. If e is a relatively low-value, taking the cubic root of the published c would potentially give your x, depending on if x is less than the cubic root of x. Another pitfall of this is that the message could easily be recovered if the same message is encrypted with the same encryption exponent with using exponent number of setups with distinct public keys. Lets say e = 3 in this case, generating public keys N1, N2, N3, and yielding C1, C2, C3. We could then recover our message by first applying the Chinese Remainder Thm to C1, C2, C3 working under the modulus N1*N2*N3, which lets say generates C0. We know our x^3 < N1*N2*N3 therefore we can take the cubic root of our generated C0 to get exactly x.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) We see that a binary number with 256 digits has a max length of 2^255+1. We also know that the distribution of primes less than a given number is modeled by pi(N) which can be approximated by N / log(N).\n",
    "We see that 2^255+1 / log ( 2^255+1) is about 3.2755 × 10^74. We can also see that the likelihood of selecting two numbers from this set and having these numbers be the same is 1/(3.2755*10^74)^2 which is about equal to \n",
    "9.3204 × 10^-150. This is an incredibly unlikely probabilty however it is not completely zero so it theoretically could happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) If Bob chooses a predictable nonce for his Elgamal encryption scheme, then k could easily be recovered. This would mean the discrete log problem would be solved for c1, giving us an accurate value of k. We could then calculate the inverse of k by running the extended Euclidean Algorithm on k and p-1, which is known as p and g are published values. Once the inverse of k is found. We could then raise A to that power and multiply this by c2. We know c2 = m*A^k, therefore if we multiply, we get m*A^k*A^(-k) = m*A. We know A therefore we can divide this value by A and get the message we want to recover.\n",
    "\n",
    "iiii) Let us consider what happens if Eve runs RSA twice. Lets say the first time the algorithm is run, we get x^e1 = c1 and the second time we get x^e2 = c2, both working under a large modulus of n. A possible exploit here would occur here if we calculate GCD(e1, e2) = 1. This means that a linear combination of e1 and e2 is equal to 1. We could find said linear combination by running the extended Euclidean Algorithm to get w1 and w2 such that w1*e1 + w2*e2 = 1. We know that both e1 and e2 are relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1). We now see that if we take c1^w1 and c2^w2, we get x^(e1*w1) and x^(e2*w2). If we multiply these values together, we get x^(e1*w1) * x^(e2*w2) = x^(e1*w1+e2*w2) = x^1 by definition. This solves the RSA encrytption algorithm as we have now recovered our message x.\n",
